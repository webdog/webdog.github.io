	<center><b>Scenario 2: <i>Developer A starts developing an Object but Developer B already is also developing it.</i></b><br>
		The scenario as shown in Git.<br>
		How are developers communicating that they are working on similar items?<br>
		There are several ways to address this conflict.<br>
		<br>
	</center>
	Resolution 1:
	<ul>
		<li>Developer A takes the commits from his branched repository off master and commits them upstream to master</li>
		<li>Developer B switches to their local copy of master</li>
		<li>Developer B runs <b>git fetch</b> to bring the changes from master upstream into their local repository</li>
		<li>Developer B runs <b>git merge</b> to merge the upstream master into local master</li>
		<li>Developer B returns to their local working branch</li>
		<li>Developer runs <b>git merge master <working_branch> </b> -- This will integrate Dev B's working branch against the updated parent branch master</li>
		
	</ul>
	
	Resolution 2:
	<ul>
		<li>Developer A decides to finish development on their branch</li>
		<li>Developer A pushes their working branch upstream to GitHub</li>
		<li>Developer A communicates this to Developer B</li>
		<li>Developer B pulls Developer A's branch locally from GitHub</li>
		<li>Developer B runs <b>git log</b> on Developer A's branch to see the commits Developer A made</li>
		<li>Developer chooses the commits to merge by their SHA, and runs <b>git cherry-pick</b> to bring these changes into their working branch</li>
	</ul>
