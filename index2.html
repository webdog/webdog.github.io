	Resolution 1:
	<ul>
		<li>Developer A takes the commits from his branched repository off master and commits them upstream to master</li>
		<li>Developer B switches to their local copy of master</li>
		<li>Developer B runs <b>git fetch</b> to bring the changes from master upstream into their local repository</li>
		<li>Developer B runs <b>git merge</b> to merge the upstream master into local master</li>
		<li>Developer B returns to their local working branch</li>
		<li>Developer runs <b>git merge master <working_branch> </b> -- This will integrate Dev B's working branch against the updated parent branch master</li>
