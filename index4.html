		<b>Scenario 4:</b> <i>Developer C's source Object just went to PROD but the Developer A and Developer B still are developing it.</i><br>
	</center>
	<p>
	In this scenario, we have three developers working off of working branches based on a common master.<br>
	Developer C has had a more pressing change to push to PROD. Git makes this manageable through the following steps<br>
	<ul>
		<li>Developer C communicates the changes to the group</li>
		<li>Developer A and B continue to work on their branches until they are ready to pull changes down from the updated master</li>
		<li>Developer A and B both run <b>git fetch</b> and <b>git merge</b> on their local master branches to update Developer C's changes</li>
		<li>Developer A and B both run <b>git merge master 'working_branch'</b> inside their working branch to incorporate the updated master's changes into their working branch</li>
		<li>Developer A and B are both up-to-date with Developer C's changes</li>
		<li>Developer A and B communicate with each other and use the workflow strategy from Scenario 2 to merge their branches</li>
	</ul>
