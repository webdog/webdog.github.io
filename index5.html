		<b>Scenario 5:</b><i>Developer D's source Object will go to PROD in 2 weeks but Developer A will start working on it.</i>
	</center>
	<p>
	In this scenario, master will not be updated for two weeks, as master is always viewed as PROD. In this case<br>
	git can alleviate this pain by the following.
	<ul>
		<li>Developer A and D communicate that D's code will not ship to master</li>
		<li>Developer A will then create a working branch with Developer D's branch acting as the parent branch</li>
		<li>Once complete, Developer A will merge their code into Developer D's branch.
		<li>Once ready for delivery, Developer D will merge back into master for PROD delivery.</li>
	</ul>
