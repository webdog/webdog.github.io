	<b>Scenario 3:</b><i>Developer A and Developer B are both developing the same source Object but Developer B will go to PROD before Developer A.</i><br>
	<p>
		This scenario can be effectively managed in git by Developer A running through the following steps:
	<ul>
		<li>Developer A communicates with Developer B about Developer B's merge into master</li>
		<li>Developer A switches out of local working branch into local master</li>
		<li>Developer A runs <b>git fetch</b> to review the changes upstream from master, and <b>git merge</b> to update the local master.</li>
		<li>Developer A switches back to local working branch</li>
		<li>Developer A runs <b>git merge master 'working_branch'</b> to incorporate the changes from master into the working branchh</li>
